Every year the NBA hosts a draft lottery for the 14 worst teams in the league. The teams with the highest percentage of losses usually has a stronger chance to end up with a first round pick.

Once I obtain more knowledge, I may add if/else statements to expand the chances of a team landing the 1st pick.
